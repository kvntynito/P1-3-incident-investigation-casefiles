# Screenshots — CASE-001 Brute Force / RDP
Status: Draft (to be updated during implementation)

Upload **case-specific, redacted evidence** here. These screenshots should support the timeline and findings documented in this case folder.

## Evidence checklist
- [ ] Starting signal (how I noticed the issue)
- [ ] Pivot: top targeted user(s)
- [ ] Pivot: top source IP/host (sanitized)
- [ ] Outcome evidence:
  - [ ] Success (4624) after failures (if observed)
  - [ ] Account lockout (4740) (if observed)
- [ ] Final supporting screenshot that confirms the conclusion

## Suggested filenames (optional)
Use short, consistent names:
- `01-starting-signal.png`
- `02-top-users.png`
- `03-top-sources.png`
- `04-outcome-success-or-lockout.png`
- `05-final-confirmation.png`

## Redaction checklist (always)
Do NOT publish:
- WAN/public IPs, domains/DDNS, VPN endpoints/keys
- passwords, API keys, tokens, secrets
- unique external identifiers

OK to publish (generally):
- representative RFC1918 ranges
- sanitized hostnames/usernames
- cropped screenshots showing workflow and evidence
