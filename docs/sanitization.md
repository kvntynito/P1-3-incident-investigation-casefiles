# Sanitization
Status: Draft (to be updated during implementation)

I do NOT publish:
- WAN/public IPs, domains/DDNS, VPN endpoints/keys
- passwords, tokens, secrets
- full exports/backups containing sensitive data

I DO publish:
- representative RFC1918 subnets
- redacted screenshots showing investigation logic
- sanitized queries and timelines
