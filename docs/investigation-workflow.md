# Investigation Workflow
Status: Draft (to be updated during implementation)

Workflow I follow for each case:
1) Confirm telemetry is present (collector + platform)
2) Identify the initial alert/signal
3) Pivot (user → host → process → network)
4) Build timeline
5) Document conclusion + next steps (containment/hardening ideas)
