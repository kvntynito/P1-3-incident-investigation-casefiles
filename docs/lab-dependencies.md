# Lab Dependencies
Status: Draft (to be updated during implementation)

This repo builds on:
- P1-1 (segmented lab + VM inventory)
- P1-2 (WEF/Sysmon telemetry pipeline)

TBD during implementation:
- Which platform is primary for screenshots (Splunk vs Elastic vs Wazuh)
- Which endpoints/targets are used per case
