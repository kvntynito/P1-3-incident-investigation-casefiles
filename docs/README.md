# Docs
Status: Draft (to be updated during implementation)

This folder contains the written documentation for this repo.

## What goes here
- Setup notes and decisions (what I configured and why)
- Platform-specific ingestion steps (Wazuh / Elastic / Splunk)
- Validation and test procedures
- Sanitization and safe publishing guidelines

## Key files
- `lab-dependencies.md` — what this repo relies on (P1-1 lab + P1-2 telemetry)
- `attack-scenarios.md` — planned scenarios and what telemetry they generate
