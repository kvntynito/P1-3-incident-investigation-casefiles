# Attack Scenarios
Status: Draft (to be updated during implementation)

Planned scenario categories:
- Authentication attacks (failed logons, lockouts, suspicious logon types)
- Endpoint behavior (PowerShell, scheduled tasks, persistence attempts)
- Web app attacks (DVWA/WebGoat patterns)

Each scenario will map to:
- telemetry sources (Security log, Sysmon IDs)
- expected artifacts
- validation queries
